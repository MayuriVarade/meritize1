                First things first. Thank you for trying out Meritize. There's <%= @plan_expiry %> days left on your trial. You can upgrade at any time. Or wait until the last day, no worries. And did you know that we charge only for users that log in? You get the idea. You spend money only if your organization uses Meritize.

                  PS: It looks like you have logged in to Meritize a few times now. Does it feel like you know your way around Meritize now? We are going to assume you don't need these instructions every time you log in. You will be redirected to the <a href="/admin_user">Manager Users</a> screen the next time you login. If you do need these instructions, just click on "Meritize" in the far upper left and you will find this page.

            <h1>Account settings</h1>
            The first place to start would be the Settings area. We have set some defaults for you. Click on Settings and you will see that you can set General settings, and you can set settings for Props and/or Votes depending on which plan you sign up for. 

            <h1>Users</h1>
            The second thing to do is to go to the Users area and create users. We recommend creating two or three users to start off. You will want to login as a user to see how your users will use Meritize. And you need a couple of other users to give props and vote for an award.
            <br>

            <br>Here's the the step-by-step:<br>
            1. Go to <a href="/admin_user">Users - Manage Users</a> and click the Add new User button to create a new user. Use an email address you have access to. The password is sent to the email address.<br>
            2. Repeat Step 1 two more times to create two more users.<br>
            3. Log out and log back in, or open a new browser and <a href="http://www.imeritize.com">login to Meritize</a>, using the email address for the user created on Step 1.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Give props from the Props screen<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Vote for one of the users for an awards program<br>
            4. Log out and log back in, or open a new browser and <a href="http://www.imeritize.com">login to Meritize</a>, using the email address you used to first sign-up for Meritize. Which is basically the email address you have used to login currently.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>
              Now that you are logged back in as the administraor, click <a href="/results/props">Results - Props</a> or click <a href="/results/votes">Reults - Votes</a>. You will the props and votes you submitted as a user generates a leaderboard.
              Finally, click on <a href="/adminuser_logs">Users - Users Activities</a>. You will see that Meritize reports to you login history of your users.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>
            That about covers the basics. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us at support@imeritize.com.

             And click Submit Props. That's it! Scroll down and you will see props others have given. One other thing. The <a href="/prop_wows">WoW screen for Props</a> is a "Wall of Winners" and will show you the winners.
