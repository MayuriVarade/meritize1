        <p>Use this page to create several users at a time. You will need a file with a list of first name, last name, email address and department. We'll take their email address and make it their username. The system will send the new users their password. Oh, and if there is someone with that email address already, we will update their first name and last name.</p>

        Let's get started. We need a file from you. It has to be a "csv" file. That stands for comma separated values. You can create one in Excel by doing a File - Save As. Make sure to leave the column headers in so that we understand the contents of your file.
        It's important that the column headers be named this: <b>firstname,lastname,email,department. Note the lower case.</b></p>
        <p>Actually, it's more than important. If the column headers aren't that we won't be able to load the information in to the system.</p>

        <h4>Step 1. Select the CSV file that has all the users</h4>
        <%= form_tag import_users_path, multipart: true do %>
        <%= file_field_tag :file, accept: 'text/csv' %></br>
        <%=  hidden_field_tag :admin_user_id , :value => current_user.id %>

        <h4>Step 2.</h4>
        After you have uploaded the file, click the button below to kick off the upload process. Note that by clicking this button you certify that you are authorized to create users. And that you understand that an email will be sent immediately to the users at the email address in the csv file.<br />
        <%= submit_tag "Everything checks out. Let's do this!",:class => "button button-primary" %>
      <% end %>
